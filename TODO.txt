* refactoring: adapt documentation
* next_after method, 
* add arithmetic using Rational (BigDecimal for decimal types?)
  (maybe some directly on sign-significand-exponent); AlgM can be used for rounding
* implement BurgerDybvig for Values; (use the iterative scale2 instead of scale)  
* reserach if the double rounding that's happening in nio_read_neutral may be a real problem
  (the neutral is first rounded to decimal_digits_necessary, then to a FP datum)
* rename :normalized_significand to :scientific_significand ? :denormal to :subnormal ? etc.
* rename as_ methods removing the as_; rename "as" to "to"; consider better names for number (numeric?), text, splitted/split
    
* classes.rb :
  - there's too many similar     to_integral_sign_significand_exponent/from_integral_sign_significand_exponent
    methods; some refactoring is in order
* confirm git rubyforge repository is working
