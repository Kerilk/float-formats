* refactoring: adapt tests and documentation
* next_after method, 
* add comparisons to Value <=>
* add arithmetic to Value using Rational (BigDecimal for decimal types?)
  (maybe some directly on sign-significand-exponent); AlgM can be used for rounding
* implement BurgerDybvig for Values; (use the iterative scale2 instead of scale)  
* reserach if the double rounding that's happening in from_fmt may be a real problem
  (the neutral is first formatted to decimal_digits_necessary, then to a FP datum)
* rename :normalized_significand to :scientific_significand ? :denormal to :subnormal ? etc.
* rename as_ methods removing the as_; consider better names for number, text, splitted/split
* implement nio_read/_write using the Nio::Formattable mixin
    
* classes.rb :
  - there's too many similar     to_integral_sign_significand_exponent/from_integral_sign_significand_exponent
    methods; some refactoring is in order
