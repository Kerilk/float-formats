* Write RDoc Documentation
* Publish Gem
* initialize instance variables such as @hidden_bit (see warnings) to nil when not using them.
* classes.rb :
  - there's too many similar     to_integral_sign_significand_exponent/from_integral_sign_significand_exponent
    methods; some refactoring is in order
* A solution is needed for the documentation of the format constants of FltPnt in RDoc.
  Apart from researching how to control RDoc, it could be convenient to add a comments
  (and name) parameters to the floating point formats and use them for documentation.
* Bug to fix: does not work without include FltPnt
* A multi-platform gem could be set up for IEEE_FPU; for win32-msvcrt no extension is needed;
  for other platforms the ieee_fpu_control extension should be compiled.
* the gem installation says is not found (rdoc problem?)
