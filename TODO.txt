* classes.rb :
  - there's too many similar     to_integral_sign_significand_exponent/from_integral_sign_significand_exponent
    methods; some refactoring is in order
* A solution is needed for the documentation of the format constants of FltPnt in RDoc.
  Apart from researching how to control RDoc, it could be convenient to add a comments
  (and name) parameters to the floating point formats and use them for documentation.
