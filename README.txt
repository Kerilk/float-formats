Float-Formats is a Ruby package with methods to handle diverse floating-point formats.

==Purpose

* Enconding and decoding numerical values in specifica floating point formats
* Conversion of floating-point data between different formats
* Obtaining properties of floating-point formats (ranges, precision, etc)
* Exploring and learning about floating point representations
* Definition and testing of new floating-point formats


=Usage
